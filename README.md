# Encryption Decryption Photo Algorithm
This program encrypts/decrypts a .bmp photo using a secret_key from a .txt file and performs the chi-test.

## The First Part: Encryption
The program receives the name for the .bmp image, the name for the encrypted one and the .txt file which contains the secret key.
```
 peppers.bmp (the name of the image)
 
 imagine_criptata.bmp (the name for the encrypted image)
 
 secret_key.txt (the secret key)
```

## The Second Part: Decryption
The program receives the name for the encrypted image, the name for the decrypted one and the .txt file which contains the secret key.
```
 imagine_criptata.bmp (the name of the encrypted image)
 
 imagine_decriptata.bmp (the name for the decrypted image)
 
 secret_key.txt (the secret key)
```

## The Third Part: The chi-square Test
The chi-squared test is used to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the expected frequencies and the observed frequencies in one or more categories of a so-called contingency table.
